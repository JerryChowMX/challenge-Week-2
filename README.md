# GitHub Homework - Challenge Week Two

## Project Overview

This repository contains my completed portfolio website for a GitHub homework assignment. The project involved implementing several user stories to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio website.

## User Stories

### Viewing the Portfolio

- **GIVEN** I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
  **WHEN** I load their portfolio  
  **THEN** I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

   **Completed**: The portfolio website displays the developer's name and a recent photo prominently on the landing page. Clear navigation links are provided to different sections, including an "About Me" section, a "My Work" section showcasing titled images of applications, and a "Contact Me" section. 

### Navigation Links

- **WHEN** I click one of the links in the navigation  
  **THEN** the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

   **Completed**: The navigation links are fully functional. When clicked, they smoothly scroll the user to the corresponding sections of the page, enhancing the user experience.

### Work Section

- **WHEN** I click on the link to the section about their work  
  **THEN** the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

   **Completed**: Clicking on the "My Work" link in the navigation takes the user to a dedicated section displaying titled images of the developer's applications. This ensures easy access to the portfolio of work.

### Large Application Image

- **WHEN** I am presented with the developer's first application  
  **THEN** that application's image should be larger in size than the others

   **Completed**: The portfolio website highlights the developer's first application by presenting its image in a larger size compared to the others. This draws attention to the featured project.

### Clicking on Application Images

- **WHEN** I click on the images of the applications  
  **THEN** I am taken to that deployed application

   **Completed**: Each application has a link that is clickable, providing users with a direct link to the deployed application. This allows for a seamless transition from viewing the portfolio to exploring the actual projects.

### Responsive Layout

- **WHEN** I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
  **THEN** I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

   **Not Completed**: The portfolio website is not designed with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. I've gotten help and i now know how to.
